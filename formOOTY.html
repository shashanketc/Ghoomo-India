            <h2>About Ooty</h2>
            <p>The popular hill station Ooty is a shorter derivation from its original name Udhagamandalam, sometimes
                called Ootacamund. During earlier times it was also called OttaikalMandu. The charm and beauty of this
                hill station in Nilgiri hills calls for the name it got, ‘The Queen of Hill Stations’. It is called a
                nature lover’s paradise too, due to its greens, wonderful blue Mountains, rippling clear lakes, alpine
                woods and lively climate like that of English summers.
            </p>

            <p>It is said that these mountains derives those misty blue haze from the Eucalyptus trees that cover these
                hills or maybe from the Kurunji flowers that are blue in color and blossoms after every 12 years.

                The scenic hill station is a desired honeymoon destination due to its heavenly beautiful plantations,
                conifers, lavenders, Eucalyptus tresses and graciously flowing cold breeze.</p>

            <p>The summer season is perhaps the best time to visit Ooty hill station. With the average temperature
                ranging around 25°C, days can be a little hot though, especially during the afternoon. But at other
                times, the heat is bearable. The occasional rains also sweep away some heat to keep Ooty enjoyable. And
                it even gets cold enough at night for you to put on some warm clothes.

                With only the occasional warmth of the sun there to remind you that it is actually summer, you can
                comfortably visit any place you have in mind in and around Ooty, without having to fear the dreaded
                heat. It will also be a good way to escape the scorching heat, that will be burning the other parts of
                the country, at least for a few days. Besides it actually gets chilly during the night.</p>

            <p>Ooty lies at North of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu covering an area of 36 sq Kms. It is the capital of
                Nilgiris district. Ooty is mainly inhabited by Todas, Kotas, Kurumbas, Panias and Irula tribes.The hill
                station is about 2240 meters above sea level. The climate of the place is mild and pleasant throughout
                the year with an average ranging from 17–20 °C and winters dipping to the temperatures of 0º C. April to
                June and September to November is a good time to visit Ooty.</p>
