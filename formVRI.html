            <h2>About Vrindavan</h2>
            <p>Vrindavan takes its name literally from “forest of Tulsi” or the Holy Basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum). Two
                groves of these Tulsi herbs can still be seen in Sewa Kunj and Nidhivan both of which are situated near
                the city and were the favorite sites for Radha and Krishna as well as the Gopis for conducting their
                ‘dance of devout passion’ or ‘Raas Lila’.
            </p>

            <p>Vrindavan is a city of temples and ashrams where devotees of Lord Krishna have built, extended or
                contributed towards increasing the creature comforts for the devotees thronging to the divine pilgrimage
                site. The city virtually reverberates with the resounding chants of ‘Radhe Krishna’ during the morning
                and evening hours when six ‘pujas’ or ‘aartis’ are performed and the ‘prasad’ or ‘bhog’ is also
                distributed.
            </p>

            <p>The divine love of Radha and Krishna, the mischievous antics of the naughty, youthful Krishna and the cow
                herd maidens or Gopis, the gentle care of the Gokul chieftain, Nand and his wife Yashodha’s great love
                for her foster child Krishna as was his love for his elder brother, Balram – all are the substance of
                myths, rituals, traditions, events and festivals that make Vrindavan such a sought after tourist
                attraction.</p>

            <p>Vrindavan is the prominent centre for the dance form, ‘Raas Lila’ or the dance of divine devotion along
                with Rasiya songs forming the backdrop to the dances where the girls carry lamps on their heads and
                swing through various formations to the tune of myriad musical instruments.

                The great music festival, ‘Swami Haridas Sammelan’ is organized in the memory of Swami Haridas. He was
                the Guru of the great singing maestro, Tansen. Tansen was one of the nine talented gems in the court of
                King Akbar. Thus, Vrindavan has unique distinction of being a seat of learning and cultural expansion of
                the mind and spirit both.</p>
