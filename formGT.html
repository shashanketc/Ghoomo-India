            <h2>About Golden Temple</h2>
            <p>The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar. The Golden temple is famous for its
                full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft
                square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half of the
                building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of
                other famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who had initially
                constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir Sahib. It is here
                that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have spent their fourteen-year
                exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a garden, and the tower of
                Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. </p>
