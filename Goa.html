          <p>
            Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic
            tourists each year because of its white-sand beaches, active
            nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed
            architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna because it lies
            very close to the North Western Ghats rainforests, one of the rare
            biodiversity hotspots of the world. Panaji is the state's capital,
            while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of
            Margão in Goa still exhibits the cultural influence of the
            Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early
            16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter,
            whereupon Goa became an overseas territory of the Portuguese
            Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and
            remained as such for about 456 years until it was annexed by India
            in 1961. Goa's official language, which is spoken by a
            majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the Delhi Sultanate. The kingdom's grip on the region was weak,
            and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to Harihara I of the Vijayanagara Empire. The Vijayanagara
            monarchs held on to the territory until 1469 when it was appropriated by the Bahmani sultans of Gulbarga.
            After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur, who established as
            their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as Velha Goa (or Old Goa). Goa's seven major
            rivers are the Mandovi, Zuari, Terekhol, Chapora, Galgibag, Cumbarjua canal, Talpona, and the Sal. The
            Zuari and the Mandovi are the most important rivers, interspaced by the Cumbarjua canal, forming a major
            estuarine complex. These rivers are fed by the Southwest monsoon rain and their basin covers 69% of the
            state's geographical area. These rivers are some of the busiest in India. Goa has more than 40
            estuarine, eight marine, and about 90 riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa's rivers is 253 km
            (157 mi). Goa has more than 300 ancient water tanks built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over
            100 medicinal springs.

            Shaped like the new moon, Goa’s beaches are known the world over. Fringed by swaying palm and coconut trees
            with cool and comfortable shacks offering a variety of refreshments, Goa’s 103 km coastline is blessed with
            the most enchanting beaches lapped by the Arabian Sea. And almost all of them are swimmer friendly with the
            assured presence of lifeguards on all the popular beaches. 105 kms of Konkan coast stretches across the
            state of Goa providing a wide range of choice in beaches to suit everybody’s needs. There are unspoilt
            pristine stretches of sand for the solitude seeker and there are those ones jammed with people in every
            square feet of sand. <br><br>



            There are beaches far from human habitation with very basic or sometimes no facility for accommodation. Then
            there are some with ultra modern comforts like internet cafes, massage centers, gyms, swimming pools, night
            clubs, etc. With such an enormous choice, one might feel confused about which one to take.



            But on the contrary, it’s quite easy to plan an itinerary for getting suntan allover the body. Taking the
            capital Panaji and the next major city Margao as base points, all the beaches can be visited in a stretch.
            North from Panaji lies the most famous beach of Calangute.From here onwards to the northern tip of the
            state, swaying palms and shimmering sands stretch giving an enchanting sight.The further north, the emptier
            the beaches become.
