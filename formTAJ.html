            <h2>About Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna River in the Indian city
                of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite
                wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.</p>
            <p>The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, employing thousands of
                artisans and craftsmen. The architectural beauty of the Taj Mahal, with its intricate designs,
                calligraphy, and symmetrical layout, has made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic
                landmarks globally.</p>
            
            <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is featured in almost all literature about India and is one of the most
                enduring images of the country. Its name is believed to have been drawn from the Persian language: ‘taj’
                means crown and ‘mahal’ means palace, thus making this the palace of the crown. Interestingly, the queen
                it was built in memory of, originally named Arjumand Begum, held the name Mumtaz Mahal, which meant the
                crown of the palace. </p>
                <p>Although it is best known as a symbol of love, a grieving emperor’s ode to his
                deceased queen, another legend sees the Taj Mahal as an embodiment of Shah Jahan’s vision of kingship.
                The story goes that he sought to build something akin to heaven on earth, a spectacular, unbelievably
                beautiful monument that reinforced the power as well as the perceived divinity of the monarch as next
                only to the Almighty.</p>
