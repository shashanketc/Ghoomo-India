            <h2>About Ahmedabad</h2>
            <p>Ahmedabad is the largest city in the State of Gujarat and the Seventh- largest urban agglomeration in
                India, with a population of almost 74 lakhs (7.4 Million). City is Located on the banks of the River
                Sabarmati. The city is the administrative centre of Ahmedabad district, and was the capital of Gujarat
                from 1960 to 1970; the capital was shifted to Gandhinagar thereafter. </p>

            <p>The city was at the forefront of
                the Indian independence movement in the first half of 20th century. It was the epicentre of many
                campaigns of civil disobedience to promote workers’ right, civil rights and political independence.
                Mahatma Gandhi also established Gandhi Ashram on the bank of river Sabarmati and selected Ahmedabad as
                his “Karmabhumi”.The city was founded in 1411 to serve as the capital of the Sultanate of Gujarat, by
                its namesake, Sultan Ahmed Shah. Under British rule, a military Cantonment was established and the city
                infrastructure was modernized and expanded. </p>

            <p>It was part of the Bombay Presidency during the British rules in India. Kankaria Lake, in the
                neighbourhood of Maninagar, is an artificial lake developed by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the Sultan of Delhi,
                in 1451 A.D. The city is also called Karnavati, a name for an older town that existed in the walled
                area. Ahmedabad remained the most important city in the Gujarat region. The City established itself as
                the home of a booming textile industry, which earned the nickname “The Manchester of India.” With the
                creation of the state of Gujarat in 1960, Ahmedabad gained prominence as the political and commercial
                capital of the state. Once characterized by dusty roads and congested localities, the city is witnessing
                a major construction boom and population increase. </p>

                <p>A rising centre of education, information technology
                    and scientific industries, Ahmedabad remains the cultural and commercial heart of Gujarat, and much of
                    western India. Since 2000, the city has been transformed through the construction of skyscrapers,
                    shopping malls and multiplexes.</p>
