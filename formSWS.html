            <h2>About Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
            <p>Sariska National Park, national park and wildlife preserve in eastern Rajasthan state, northwestern
                India. It has an area of 190 square miles (492 square km). It was established in 1955 in Sariska Forest
                as a wildlife sanctuary and was declared a national park in 1979. Acacia forests cover the arid lower
                slopes of the hills and the deep, narrow valleys; male bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus), the culms
                (stems) of which form nearly solid, impenetrable thickets, grows along the streams. Wildlife includes
                tigers, leopards, wild pigs, nilgai (Indian antelope), chital, porcupines, peafowl, partridges, and
                thrushes. Kankwari Fort, a Shiva temple of the 12th century, and a 10th-century Neelkanth (Shiva) temple
                are of archaeological interest. There are good roads within the park and observation towers at Bandi Pul
                and Kalighati.

            <p>Ecosystem, the complex of living organisms, their physical environment, and all their interrelationships
                in a particular unit of space.

                A brief treatment of ecosystems follows. For full treatment, see biosphere.

                An ecosystem can be categorized into its abiotic constituents, including minerals, climate, soil, water,
                sunlight, and all other nonliving elements, and its biotic constituents, consisting of all its living
                members. Linking these constituents together are two major forces: the flow of energy through the
                ecosystem and the cycling of nutrients within the ecosystem. Ecosystems vary in size: some are small
                enough to be contained within single water droplets while others are large enough to encompass entire
                landscapes and regions (see biome).</p>

            <p>The fundamental source of energy in almost all ecosystems is radiant energy from the Sun. The energy of
                sunlight is used by the ecosystem’s autotrophic, or self-sustaining, organisms (that is, those that can
                make their own food). Consisting largely of green vegetation, these organisms are capable of
                photosynthesis—i.e., they can use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into
                simple, energy-rich carbohydrates. The autotrophs use the energy stored within the simple carbohydrates
                to produce the more complex organic compounds, such as proteins, lipids, and starches, that maintain the
                organisms’ life processes. The autotrophic segment of the ecosystem is commonly referred to as the
                producer level.</p>

            <p>Nutrients are chemical elements and compounds that organisms must obtain from their surroundings for
                growth and the sustenance of life. Although autotrophs obtain nutrients primarily from the soil while
                heterotrophs obtain nutrients primarily from other organisms, the cells of each are made up primarily of
                six major elements that occur in similar proportions in all life-forms. These elements—hydrogen, oxygen,
                carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur—form the core protoplasm (that is, the semifluid substance that
                makes up a cell’s cytoplasm and nucleus) of organisms. The first four of these elements make up about 99
                percent of the mass of most cells. Additional elements, however, are also essential to the growth of
                organisms. Calcium and other elements help to form cellular support structures such as shells, internal
                or external skeletons, and cell walls. Chlorophyll molecules, which allow photosynthetic plants to
                convert solar energy into chemical energy, are chains of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen compounds built
                around a magnesium ion. Altogether, 16 elements are found in all organisms; another eight elements are
                found in some organisms but not in others.</p>
