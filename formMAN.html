            <h2>About Manali</h2>
            <p>Situated near the end of valley, Manali is one of the most attractive tourist spot not only of Himachal
                Pradesh, but of International fame also. Manali is synonymous streams and birdsong, forests and orchards
                and grandees of snow-capped mountains.

                Manali is the real starting point of an ancient trade route which crosses the Rohtang and Baralacha
                passes, and runs via Lahul and Ladakh to Kashmir while divergent road connects it with Spiti. Now the
                motor link have been provided up to Leh in Jammu & Kashmir, Pangi valley in Chamba and Kaza of Lahul &
                Spiti. There are regular bus services to these places from Manali during summer season. It is situated
                at a distance of 45 kms from Kullu.</p>

            <p>There is an interesting legend about Manali which goes to say that Manu, the author of ’Manu Samhita’,
                after the great deluge first stepped on the earth from the celestial boat at a place in this land. The
                particular spot where he established his abode was the present Manali which is regarded as the changed
                name of ’Manu-Alaya’, the abode of Manu. The temple dedicated to Manu is still existing in the Manali
                village.</p>

            <p>When sound of exhilaration seems to be coming far above from sky and only colorful para-gliders could be
                spotted above head, the site is most probably Solang Valley of Manali Hill Station, which has a
                uniqueness that stands out from any other paragliding site in India. What more this is one facet of this
                hill city, like honeymooner trying to pose wearing ski gears rather than actually willing to try the fun
                of skiing. Add to that elders on some sort of minor pilgrimage to various temples in Manali, individual
                getting holy dip in hot water springs, families bonding in picnic spots and many other images, and this
                hill city comes alive in front of eyes.</p>

            <p>A part of Beas River Valley, Manali is situated at an altitude of more than 2000 m from where the eyes
                fall on the views of forests, orchards, river, mountains ranges and more, for nothing but sheer visual
                delight. The place once used to serve trade purposes via Manal - Leh route; now the same route is used
                for the purpose of adventure mainly for the bikers and jeep riders.</p>
