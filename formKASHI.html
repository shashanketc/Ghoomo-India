            <h2>About Kashi</h2>
            <p>Kashi Vishvanath Temple is one of the most famous Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in
                Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is
                one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shivatemples. The main deity is known by the name
                Vishvanatha or Vishveshvara meaning Ruler of The Universe. Varanasi city is also called Kashi, and hence
                the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishvanath Temple.</p>

            <p>Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s
                Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature,
                who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote :
                “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as
                all of them put together”.

                The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe
                that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle
                of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges
                in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who
                is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and
                re-birth.</p>

            <p>The city is a center of learning and civilization for over 3000 years. Ganges is said to have its origins
                in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands to the mighty river that we know of. With
                Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment, just 10 km away, Varanasi
                has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge, philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts
                and crafts have all flourished here for centuries. Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is
                believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath, the twenty-third Tirthankar. Vaishnavism and Shaivism have
                co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously.</p>

            <p>Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with promotion of
                spiritualism, mysticism, Sanskrit, yoga and Hindi language and honored authors such as the ever-famous
                novelist Prem Chand and Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called as the
                cultural capital of India, Varanasi has provided the right platform for all cultural activities to
                flourish. Many exponents of dance and music have come from Varanasi. Ravi Shankar, the internationally
                renowned Sitar maestro and Ustad Bismillah Khan, (the famous Shehnai player) are all sons of the blessed
                city or have lived here for major part of their lives.</p>
